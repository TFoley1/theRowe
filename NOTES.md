Been having trouble with getting my dropdowns to work with my navbar. Since I've had this problem so many times I'm documenting the solution. You need to put the dropdown content INSIDE the container for it to be visible.

## For others!!

I am using the **IDE** [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) to edit and test code. It can be seen [here](https://the-rowe.glitch.me/index.html) on glitch.com or whats live on github can be seen [here](https://tfoley1.github.io/theRowe/index.html) aswell. 

**Whats on glitch is what you're supposed to see but might have issues with parity between the two.**
