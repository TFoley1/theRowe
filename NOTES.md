## For others!!

I am using the **IDE** [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) to edit and test code. It can be seen [here](https://the-rowe.glitch.me/index.html) on glitch.com or whats live on github can be seen [here](https://tfoley1.github.io/theRowe/index.html) aswell. 

**Whats on glitch is what you're supposed to see but might have issues with parity between the two.**
