# This is my personal website

> I made (and am still making) this website for fun. It's something I've always wanted to do. The motivation behind it is that I need to spend 20 hours working on something for my capstone project to graduate highschool. This website is the perfect opportunity to do exactly that and have some fun.

### Make sure to check out the [TODO](https://github.com/TFoley1/theRowe/blob/main/TODO.md) and [NOTES](https://github.com/TFoley1/theRowe/blob/main/NOTES.md) pages if you plan on contributing. They may help you out :)


This is meant for..

- A capstone project for school
- Creative Expression
- Fun :)

## What's in this project?

Kind of a simple and messy website (probably going to devolve into spaghetti code). It could definetly be more organized and optimized. It works for now though.

Uses:
- Html 5
- Css something
- Javascript
- Materialize


Pages:
- Different pages for contact
- Content page (Youtube,Twitch, etc.) Things I Create
- anything that might seem important to add or fun to add
