# This is my personal website

> I made (and am still making) this website for fun. It's something I've always wanted to do. The motivation behind it is that I need to spend 20 hours working on something for my capstone project to graduate highschool. This website is the perfect opportunity to do exactly that and have some fun.

This is meant for..

- A capstone project for school
- Creative Expression
- Fun :)

## What's in this project?



Uses:
- Html 5
- Css something
- Javascript
- Materialize


Pages:
- Different pages for contact
- Content page (Youtube,Twitch, etc.) Things I Create
- anything that might seem important to add or fun to add
